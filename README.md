## Technologies Used

Frontend: Javascript, CSS

Backend: Ruby on Rails

## Features

Complex CSS organizes user's cars into aesthetic cards within their garage.

Cycle through the cards to view information on the car, including starting price, drivetrain layout, and fuel economy. Click "more information" to be redirected to the car's information page that contains further car attributes.

Add a car to the garage or remove one, which will adjust the users garage in the backend, as well.

App contains a very robust vehicle search feature. A user can type anything from "Honda Civic" to "SUV" to "hybrid" and get a list of matches.

## Future Modifications

Create a strong car recommendation feature. The App will ask a user a series of questions, including their budget, priorities in style, economy, or driving enjoyment, and desired vehicular style. Afterwards, the app will recommend a list of three cars that best suit the user's needs.
